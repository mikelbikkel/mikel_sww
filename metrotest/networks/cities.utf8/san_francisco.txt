# Line K and T
# ________________________________________________________

# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Ingleside
#
# At West Portal Station, inbound K trains heading towards downtown change their signs to the T line; 
# conversely, at Embarcadero Station, T trains heading into downtown change signs to the K line.
#
# The trains show the ultimate destination of the spliced lines rather than the intermediate "terminus" 
# of the individual line.
